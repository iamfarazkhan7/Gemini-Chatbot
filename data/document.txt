Cristiano Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in 2009 from Manchester United for a world-record transfer fee of €94 million. The Portuguese forward signed a six-year contract with the Spanish giants.

During his nine-year stint at Real Madrid, Ronaldo became the club's all-time leading scorer. He netted 451 goals in 438 appearances across all competitions, maintaining an incredible average of over one goal per game.

Ronaldo won four Champions League titles with Real Madrid (2014, 2016, 2017, 2018). He was instrumental in the club's historic three consecutive Champions League victories from 2016 to 2018.

The Portuguese star also won two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey trophies, and four FIFA Club World Cup titles during his time at the Santiago Bernabéu.

In 2018, Ronaldo left Real Madrid to join Juventus in a €100 million transfer, ending one of the most successful individual careers in the club's history.
